User Manual & Things to do.


Notes:
1. In Project Page, separates by comma, so if there are Exclamations, the parsing
code doesn't do anything.
Important things:

When pushing to heroku, must switch devUrl to prodUrl in 3 places:
1. Proj.js
2. Project.js
3. Proj2.js


// Inspecting body of requests:
Using Body Parse
Ex) bodyParser = require('body-parser').json();
app.post('/itemSearch', bodyParser, function(req, res) {
  //var Keywords = req.body.Keywords;
  console.log("Yoooooo");
  console.log(req.headers);
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send("yay");
});


Little Things to fix:
- In the Projects page, the "Proj" component has trouble when rendering footer because its
generated after and has some weird css issues that make them overlap.  Currently hardcoded
height to 1000.
